        <h2 className='headings'>Education </h2> 
        <p className='paragraph-text'>As a Computer Science Engineering student, I have completed Bachelor's of Technology in the year of 2022 which consists of various core subjects, equipping me with a solid understanding of the fundamentals of computer science. My coursework covers essential programming languages such as C, Java, and Python, enabling me to develop robust software applications and algorithms. I have honed my skills in data structures, which are vital for efficient data organization and manipulation. Additionally, I have acquired knowledge in Database Management Systems (DBMS), which empowers me to design and manage databases efficiently. This well-rounded education has provided me with a deep understanding of software development and data management, making me a versatile and capable computer scientist, ready to contribute to innovative and technically demanding projects.</p>

      <div  >
        <h2 className='headings'>Work Experience</h2>
        <p className='paragraph-text'>I have had the privilege of working at Hexaware Technologies for the past year, during which I have undergone comprehensive training in a range of technologies. My journey began with in-depth training in Java and SQL providing me with a strong foundation in these essential programming languages. Later, I expanded my skill set through additional training in .NET, React, and React Bootstrap, where I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge to practical projects. What truly sets my experience apart is the hands-on application of my skills in the real world. I actively contributed to the development of three substantial case studies â€“ an Appointment Management System, a Loan Management System, and an Order Management System. These projects pushed me to not only apply my technical skills but also develop problem-solving capabilities and project management expertise. Working on these projects was a valuable lesson in the practical implementation of technology to address real-world challenges.These experiences not only deepened my technical expertise but also honed my problem-solving and project management skills. I continue to be passionate about learning and growing within these technologies, remaining committed to staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field</p>
